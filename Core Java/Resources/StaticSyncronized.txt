

Class ABC {

  static Synchronized m1(){
  
  }
   
  static Synchronized m2(){
  
  }
  
  static m3(){
  
  } 
  
  Synchronized m4(){
  
  } 
  
  m5(){
  
  } 

}


explanation ::


1) When thread1 accesses m1() ..then it accquires class level lock on all static methods in class ABC (m1() , m2())
2) other threads thread2,thread3... cannot access m1() and other static synchronized method ( m2()).
3) other threads can access m3(),m4(),m5()..........(but m4() is synchronized so the thread which access this will get method level lock as specified in previous doc)
