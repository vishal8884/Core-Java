At some point we need thread to communicate with each other.



wait()
notify()
notifyAll()



example::

We have two threads which want ot access synchronized object o

1) Thread1 : t1
2) Thread2 : t2
3) Object o


step 1 -> t1 is invoking method in object o..
step 2 -> t2 wants to invoke the same object o (t2 has high priority set)
step 3 -> t1 will go into wait state by calling wait()
step 4 -> t2 will perform its job and after completing invoke notify() (which notifies lock on object)
step 5 -> t1 will see that notify() is called by t1 and it will resume its operation in object o
