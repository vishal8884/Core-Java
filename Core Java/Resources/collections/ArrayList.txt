ArrayList


1) uses an array to store the data
2) FAST ACCESS
3) insertion and deletions are very slow (because it needs to re-shuffle entire array)
4) by default capacity size is 10...beyond 10 it will create 1.5 times the initial array

When to use

1) lot of read operations instead of instead and delete
