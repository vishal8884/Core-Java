            FirstResource
               fm1()
               fm2()
            Second resource
               sm1()
               sm2()
               
               
       In the below steps in DeadLockDemo
       
       Thread1 -> we created it                       (Thread t1 = new Thread(this);)
       Thread2 -> main thread        
               
               
Step 1 ->  Thread1 accquires lock on FirstResource (method1() and method2())

step 2 -> before Thread1 reaches sr.method2() (where it accquires lock on second resource ...line 15 FirstResource.class)
          Thread2 would have accquired lock on SecondResource (sr obj)
          
step 3 -> Thread1 will wait for Thread2 to release lock on SeconfResource so that it can access sr.method2().

Step 4 -> Thread2 will wait for Thread1 to release lock of FirstResource so that it can access fr.method2()          
          
step 3 -> as a result both t1 and t2 will wait for each other causing dead lock
