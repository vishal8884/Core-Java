List 

1) ArrayList
2) LinkedList
3) Vector --> syncronized (old not used now)


Set

1) HashSet       --> LinkedHashSet        (Linked means insertion order is maintained)
2) SortedSet     --> TreeSet              (Tree means we have either ascending order or desending order)


 
Queue                --> linked list is also a queue

1) Priority queue



Map       -> used to store key and value pair


1) HashMap   --> LinkedHashMap
2) SortedMap --> treeMap
3) HashTable --> syncronized (we rarely used synchronized collections as most of the java applications are multithreaded)
